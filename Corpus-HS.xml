<story>Creation  
<book name="Genesis"> 
	{1:1} In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
	{1:2} And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 
	{1:3} And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 
	{1:4} And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 
	{1:5} And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. 
	{1:6} And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 
	{1:7} And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so. 
	{1:8} And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. 
	{1:9} And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so. 
	{1:10} And God called the dry [land] Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that [it was] good. 
	{1:11} And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, [and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed [is] in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 
	{1:12} And the earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. 
	{1:13} And the evening and the morning were the third day.
	{1:14} And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 
	{1:15} And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 
	{1:16} And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.
	{1:17} And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 
	{1:18} And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good. 
	{1:19} And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 
	{1:20} And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 
	{1:21} And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. 
	{1:22} And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 
	{1:23} And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
	{1:24} And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 
	{1:25} And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. 
	{1:26} And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
	{1:27} So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 
	{1:28} And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 
	{1:29} And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
	{1:30} And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life, [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so. 
	{1:31} And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. 
	{2:1} Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 
	{2:2} And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 
	{2:3} And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. </book>

<story>Noah and the Flood Genesis 6-9 
<book name="Genesis"> 
	{6:1} And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 
	{6:2} That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they [were] fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. 
	{6:3} And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also [is] flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 
	{6:4} There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare [children] to them, the same [became] mighty men which [were] of old, men of renown. 
	{6:5} And GOD saw that the wickedness of man [was] great in the earth, and [that] every imagination of the thoughts of his heart [was] only evil continually. 
	{6:6} And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 
	{6:7} And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. 
	{6:8} But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. 
	{6:9} These [are] the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man [and] perfect in his generations, [and] Noah walked with God. 
	{6:10} And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
	{6:11} The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 
	{6:12} And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. 
	{6:13} And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 
	{6:14} Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 
	{6:15} And this [is the fashion] which thou shalt make it [of:] The length of the ark [shall be] three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 
	{6:16} A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; [with] lower, second, and third [stories] shalt thou make it. 
	{6:17} And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life, from under heaven; [and] every thing that [is] in the earth shall die. 
	{6:18} But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee. 
	{6:19} And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every [sort] shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep [them] alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 
	{6:20} Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every [sort] shall come unto thee, to keep [them] alive. 
	{6:21} And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather [it] to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 
	{6:22} Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he. 
	{7:1} And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. 
	{7:2} Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that [are] not clean by two, the male and his female. 
	{7:3} Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 
	{7:4} For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. 
	{7:5} And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. 
	{7:6} And Noah [was] six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. 
	{7:7} And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 
	{7:8} Of clean beasts, and of beasts that [are] not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 
	{7:9} There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. 
	{7:10} And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. 
	{7:11} In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. 
	{7:12} And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 
	{7:13} In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 
	{7:14} They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. 
	{7:15} And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life. 
	{7:16} And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in. 
	{7:17} And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 
	{7:18} And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 
	{7:19} And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that [were] under the whole heaven, were covered. 
	{7:20} Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 
	{7:21} And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 
	{7:22} All in whose nostrils [was] the breath of life, of all that [was] in the dry [land,] died. 
	{7:23} And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained [alive,] and they that [were] with him in the ark. 
	{7:24} And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. 
	{8:1} And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that [was] with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; 
	{8:2} The fountains also of the deep and the windows ofheaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 
	{8:3} And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. 
	{8:4} And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 
	{8:5} And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth [month,] on the first [day] of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. 
	{8:6} And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 
	{8:7} And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 
	{8:8} Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 
	{8:9} But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. 
	{8:10} And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 
	{8:11} And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth [was] an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 
	{8:12} And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. 
	{8:13} And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first [month,] the first [day] of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. 
	{8:14} And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. 
	{8:15} And God spake unto Noah, saying, 
	{8:16} Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee. 
	{8:17} Bring forth with thee every living thing that [is] with thee, of all flesh, [both] of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 
	{8:18} And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him: 
	{8:19} Every beast, everycreeping thing, and every fowl, [and] whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. 
	{8:20} And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 
	{8:21} And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart [is] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. 
	{8:22} While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. 
	{9:1} And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 
	{9:2} And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth [upon] the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. 
	{9:3} Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 
	{9:4} But flesh with the life thereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 
	{9:5} And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man. 
	{9:6} Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 
	{9:7} And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. 
	{9:8} And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 
	{9:9} And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 
	{9:10} And with every living creature that [is] with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 
	{9:11} And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. 
	{9:12} And God said, This [is] the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that [is] with you,for perpetual generations: 
	{9:13} I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 
	{9:14} And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 
	{9:15} And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
	{9:16} And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that [is] upon the earth. 
	{9:17} And God said unto Noah, This [is] the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that [is] upon the earth. 
	{9:18} And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. 
	{9:19} These [are] the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. 
	{9:20} And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: 
	{9:21} And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 
	{9:22} And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 
	{9:23} And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness. 
	{9:24} And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 
	{9:25} And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 
	{9:26} And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 
	{9:27} God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 
	{9:28} And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 
	{9:29} And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died. </book>

<book name="Exodus"> 
	{2:1} And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took [to wife] a daughter of Levi. 
	{2:2} And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he [was a] goodly [child,] she hid him three months. 
	{2:3} And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and withpitch, and put the child therein; and she laid [it] in the flags by the river’s brink. 
	{2:4} And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. 
	{2:5} And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash [herself] at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 
	{2:6} And when she had opened [it,] she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This [is one] of the Hebrews’ children. 
	{2:7} Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 
	{2:8} And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother. 
	{2:9} And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give [thee] thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. 
	{2:10} And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. 
	{2:11} And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 
	{2:12} And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that [there was] no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
	{2:13} And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 
	{2:14} And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. 
	{2:15} Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. 
	{2:16} Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew [water,] and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 
	{2:17} And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
	{2:18} And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How [is it that] ye are come so soon to day? 
	{2:19} And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew [water] enough for us, and watered the flock. 
	{2:20} And he said unto his daughters, And where [is] he? why [is] it [that] ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. 
	{2:21} And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 
	{2:22} And she bare [him] a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. 
	{2:23} And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 
	{2:24} And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
	{2:25} And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto [them. ] </book> Exodus 3:1-6 
<book name="Exodus"> 
	{3:1} Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, [even] to Horeb. 
	{3:2} And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush [was] not consumed. 
	{3:3} And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 
	{3:4} And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here [am] I. 
	{3:5} And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 
	{3:6} Moreover he said, I [am] the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. </book> Exodus 18 
<book name="Exodus"> 
	{18:1} When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, [and] that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 
	{18:2} Then Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back, 
	{18:3} And her two sons; of whichthe name of the one [was] Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 
	{18:4} And the name of the other [was] Eliezer; for the God of my father, [said he, was] mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 
	{18:5} And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 
	{18:6} And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. 
	{18:7} And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of [their] welfare; and they came into the tent. 
	{18:8} And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, [and] all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and [how] the LORD delivered them. 
	{18:9} And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
	{18:10} And Jethro said, Blessed [be] the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 
	{18:11} Now I know that the LORD [is] greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly [he was] above them. 
	{18:12} And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father in law before God. 
	{18:13} And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. 
	{18:14} And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What [is] this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? 
	{18:15} And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: 
	{18:16} When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make [them] know the statutes of God, and his laws. 
	{18:17} And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest [is] not good. 
	{18:18} Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that [is] with thee: for this thing [is] too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. 
	{18:19} Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: 
	{18:20} And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
	{18:21} Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place [such] over them, [to be] rulers of thousands, [and] rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 
	{18:22} And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, [that] every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear [the burden] with thee. 
	{18:23} If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee [so,] then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. 
	{18:24} So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. 
	{18:25} And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
	{18:26} And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
	{18:27} And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land. </book> Exodus 19

	{19:1} In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they [into] the wilderness of Sinai. 
	{19:2} For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come [to] the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. 
	{19:3} And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children ofIsrael; 
	{19:4} Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and [how] I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself. 
	{19:5} Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth [is] mine: 
	{19:6} And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These [are] the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. 
	{19:7} And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. 
	{19:8} And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. 
	{19:9} And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. 
	{19:10} And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 
	{19:11} And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 
	{19:12} And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, [that ye] go [not] up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: 
	{19:13} There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether [it be] beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. 
	{19:14} And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 
	{19:15} And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at [your] wives. 
	{19:16} And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that [was] in the camp trembled. 
	{19:17} And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
	{19:18} And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because theLORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 
	{19:19} And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 
	{19:20} And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses [up] to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. 
	{19:21} And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. 
	{19:22} And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. 
	{19:23} And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. 
	{19:24} And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. 
	{19:25} So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. </book> Exodus 33 
<book name="Exodus"> 
	{33:1} And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, [and] go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: 
	{33:2} And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
	{33:3} Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou [art] a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. 
	{33:4} And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. 
	{33:5} For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye [are] a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. 
	{33:6} And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb. 
	{33:7} And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, andcalled it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, [that] every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which [was] without the camp. 
	{33:8} And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, [that] all the people rose up, and stood every man [at] his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. 
	{33:9} And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood [at] the door of the tabernacle, and [the] LORD talked with Moses. 
	{33:10} And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand [at] the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man [in] his tent door. 
	{33:11} And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. 
	{33:12} And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. 
	{33:13} Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation [is] thy people. 
	{33:14} And he said, My presence shall go [with thee,] and I will give thee rest. 
	{33:15} And he said unto him, If thy presence go not [with me,] carry us not up hence. 
	{33:16} For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? [is it] not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that [are] upon the face of the earth. 
	{33:17} And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. 
	{33:18} And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. 
	{33:19} And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shewmercy on whom I will shew mercy. 
	{33:20} And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. 
	{33:21} And the LORD said, Behold, [there is] a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: 
	{33:22} And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 
	{33:23} And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. </book>

<story>Abraham 
<book name="Genesis"> 
	{12:1} Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee: 
	{12:2} And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: 
	{12:3} And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. 
	{12:4} So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram [was] seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. 
	{12:5} And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. 
	{12:6} And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite [was] then in the land. 
	{12:7} And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. 
	{12:8} And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, [having] Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. 
	{12:9} And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. 
	{12:10} And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine [was] grievous in the land. 
	{12:11} And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou [art] a fair woman to look upon: 
	{12:12} Therefore it shallcome to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This [is] his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. 
	{12:13} Say, I pray thee, thou [art] my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
	{12:14} And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she [was] very fair. 
	{12:15} The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. 
	{12:16} And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. 
	{12:17} And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife. 
	{12:18} And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What [is] this [that] thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she [was] thy wife? 
	{12:19} Why saidst thou, She [is] my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take [her,] and go thy way. 
	{12:20} And Pharaoh commanded [his] men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. </book> Genesis 17 
<book name="Genesis"> 
	{17:1} And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I [am] the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. 
	{17:2} And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. 
	{17:3} And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 
	{17:4} As for me, behold, my covenant [is] with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. 
	{17:5} Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. 
	{17:6} And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. 
	{17:7} And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. 
	{17:8} And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. 
	{17:9} And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. 
	{17:10} This [is] my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. 
	{17:11} And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. 
	{17:12} And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which [is] not of thy seed. 
	{17:13} He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
	{17:14} And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant. 
	{17:15} And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah [shall] her name [be. ]
	{17:16} And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be [a mother] of nations; kings of people shall be of her. 
	{17:17} Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall [a child] be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? 
	{17:18} And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! 
	{17:19} And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, [and] with his seed after him. 
	{17:20} And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. 
	{17:21} But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. 
	{17:22} And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. 
	{17:23} And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. 
	{17:24} And Abraham [was] ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
	{17:25} And Ishmael his son [was] thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
	{17:26} In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. 
	{17:27} And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him. </book> Genesis 22:1-14 
<book name="Genesis"> 
	{22:1} And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, [here] I [am. ]
	{22:2} And he said, Take now thy son, thine only [son] Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. 
	{22:3} And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. 
	{22:4} Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. 
	{22:5} And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you, 
	{22:6} And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid [it] upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. 
	{22:7} And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here [am] I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where [is] the lamb for a burnt offering? 
	{22:8} And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. 
	{22:9} And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 
	{22:10} And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 
	{22:11} And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here [am] I. 
	{22:12} And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son] from me. 
	{22:13} And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind [him] a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. 
	{22:14} And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said [to] this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen. </book>
