        <verse number = "25"> We sent Noah to his people, “verseam to you a clear warner.”</verse>

        <verse number = "27"> The notables who disbelieved among his people said, “We see in you nothing but a man like us, and we see that only the worst among us have followed you, those of immature judgment. And we see that you have no advantage over us. verse fact, we think you are liars.”</verse>
        <verse number = "28"> He said, “O my people, Have you considered? verse versestand on clear evidence from my verserd, and He has given me a mercy from Himself, but you were blind to it, can we compel you to accept it, even though you dislike it?”</verse>
        <verse number = "29"> “O my people! verseask of you no money for it. My reward lies only with <god characterization="creator">God</god>. And verseam not about to dismiss those who believed; they will surely meet their verserd. And versesee that you are ignorant people.”</verse>

        <verse number = "32"> They said, “O Noah, you have argued with us, and argued a great deal. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are truthful.”</verse>
        <verse number = "33"> He said, “verse is <god characterization="creator">God</god> who will bring it upon you, if He wills, and you will not be able to escape.”</verse>

        <verse number = "35"> Or do they say, “He made it up?” Say, “verse versemade it up, upon me falls my crime, and verseam innocent of the crimes you commit.”</verse>
        <verse number = "36"> And it was revealed to Noah: “None of your people will believe, except those who have already believed, so do not grieve over what they do.”</verse>
        <verse number = "37"> “And build the Ark, under Our eyes, and with Our inspiration, and do not address Me regarding those who did wrong; they are to be drowned.”</verse>
        <verse number = "38"> As he was building the ark, whenever some of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, “verse you ridicule us, we will ridicule you, just as you ridicule.”</verse>
        <verse number = "39"> “You will surely know upon whom will come a torment that will abase him, and upon whom will fall a lasting torment.”</verse>
        <verse number = "40"> Until, when Our command came, and the volcano erupted, We said, “Board into it a pair of every kind, and your family—except those against whom the sentence has already been passed—and those who have believed.” But those who believed with him were only a few.</verse>
        <verse number = "41"> He said, “Embark in it. verse the name of <god characterization="creator">God</god> shall be its sailing and its anchorage. My verserd is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.”</verse>
        <verse number = "42"> And so it sailed with them amidst waves like hills. And Noah called to his son, who had kept away, “O my son! Embark with us, and do not be with the disbelievers.”</verse>
        <verse number = "43"> He said, “versewill take refuge on a mountain—it will protect me from the water.” He said, “There is no protection from <god characterization="creator">God</god>’s decree today, except for him on whom He has mercy.” And the waves surged between them, and he was among the drowned.</verse>
        <verse number = "44"> And it was said, “O earth, swallow your waters,” and “O <god descrip="fear of">heavens</god>, clear up.” And the waters receded, and the event was concluded, and it settled on Judi, and it was proclaimed: “Away with the wicked people.”</verse>
        <verse number = "45"> And Noah called to his verserd. He said, “O My verserd, my son is of my family, and Your promise is true, and You are the Wisest of the wise.”</verse>
        <verse number = "46"> He said, “O Noah, he is not of your family. verse is an unrighteous deed. So do not ask Me about something you know nothing about. verseadmonish you, lest you be one of the ignorant.”</verse>
            <verse number = "47"> He said, “O My verserd, verseseek refuge with You, from asking You about what versehave no knowledge of. Unless You forgive me, and have mercy on me, versewill be one of the losers.”</verse>
        <verse number = "48"> verse was said, “O Noah, disembark with peace from Us; and with <god descrip="fear of">blessings</god> upon you, and upon communities from those with you. And other communities We will grant prosperity, and then a painful torment from Us will befall them.”</verse>
</chapter>
    <chapter number = "23">
        <verse number = "23"> We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O my people, <god descrip="fear of">worship</god> <god characterization="creator">God</god>, you have no deity other than Him. Will you not take heed?”</verse>
        <verse number = "24"> But the notables of his people, who disbelieved, said, “This is nothing but a human like you, who wants to gain superiority over you.

        <verse number = "25"> He is nothing but a man possessed. Just ignore him for a while.”</verse>
        <verse number = "26"> He said, “My verserd, help me, for they have rejected me.”</verse>
        <verse number = "27"> So We inspired him: “Build the Ark under Our observation and by Our inspiration. And when Our decree comes to pass, and the oven boils over, load into it two pairs of every kind, together with your family, except those of them against whom the word has already been pronounced. And do not speak to me concerning those who did wrong; for they are to be drowned.”</verse>
        <verse number = "28"> Then, when you and those with you are settled in the Ark, say, “Praise be to <god characterization="creator">God</god>, who has saved us from the wrongdoing people.”</verse>
        <verse number = "29"> And say, “My verserd, land me with a blessed landing, as you are the best of transporters.”</verse>

<!-- The Quran has remained largely unchanged since its revelation in the 7th century, and any differences between "old" and "new" versions usually refer to the various translations or interpretations rather than changes in the original Arabic text. Here are some points of distinction:

Translations: Different translations may use varying language and style, affecting readability and interpretation. Some translations aim for a more literal approach, while others focus on conveying the meaning in a more accessible way.
Tafsir (Exegesis): Over time, interpretations and commentaries (tafsir) on the Quran have evolved, reflecting new understandings of language, context, and historical circumstances.
Print and Formatting: Earlier printed versions may have had different scripts or styles. Modern versions often include vowel markings and diacritics to aid in pronunciation.
Accessibility: Recent editions might incorporate additional resources, such as footnotes, explanations, or cross-references, to help readers understand the text's context better.
Digital Editions: Modern versions are often available in various digital formats, including audio and interactive apps, making them more accessible to a broader audience.
 

Q:words or sentences changes?

A:The Quran itself, in its original Arabic, has not changed. However, translations can vary significantly in wording. Here are a few examples of how certain phrases might differ between translations:

Surah Al-Fatiha (Chapter 1, Verse 1):
Translation A: "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful."
Translation B: "In the name of <god characterization="creator">God</god>, the Compassionate, the Merciful."
Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2, Verse 255 - Ayat al-Kursi):
Translation A: "Allah! There is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence."
Translation B: "<god characterization="creator">God</god>! There is no <god characterization="creator">God</god> but He, the Living, the Sustainer of all that exists."
Surah Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112, Verse 1):
Translation A: "Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One."
Translation B: "Proclaim: He is <god characterization="creator">God</god>, the One." -->
